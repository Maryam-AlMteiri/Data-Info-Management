# Data-Info-Management


CASE STUDY- HOSPITAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
A hospital has a large number of registered physicians described by an ID, name, and specialty. Each physician can work only in one hospital. Each hospital has an address, a name, a location, and 15 departments. These deprtments are : 
  •	Accident & Emergency
  
  •	Anesthesiology
  
  •	Bariatric Surgery
  
  •	Cardiology
  
  •	Clinical Nutrition
  
  •	Dental Centre
  
  •	Dermatology
  
  •	Nephrology
  
  •	Neurology
  
  •	Neurosurgery
  
  •	Obstetrics & Gynaecology
  
  •	Ophthalmology
  
  •	Pediatric Surgery
  
  •	Physical Therapy 
  
  •	Pulmonology 
  
  

Each deprtment has many physicians and one manager. Patients are admitted to the hospital by physicians. Any patient who is admitted must have exactly one admitting physician. A physician may optionally admit any number of patients. Once admitted, a given patient must be treated by at least one physician. A particular physician may treat any number of patients, or he or she may not treat any patients. Whenever a patient is treated by a physician, the hospital wishes to record the details of the treatment by including the date, time, and results of the treatment. 



The primary purpose of the database is to enable the management of your selected business to maintain their business information.
Our task is to:

1.	Using Data Modeler to draw an ERD, showing the relevant entities, attributes, and relationships for each of the following situations. The ERD will include the following:	

  •	The different entities that are used in the business case study to record data.  
  
  •	Include relationships that exists between the entities (1:1, 1:M or M:N).   
  
  •	Identify the  Primary Unique Identifier for each entity.
  
  •	All entities have a meaningful name respecting the renaming policy.
  
  •	All entities have at least 3 meaningful attributes. 
  
  •	Use suitable names for the relationships in your ERD.
  
  
  
2.	Using Data Modeler to transform the ERD into relational model. Identifying for each relation all Primary Keys (PKs) and Foreign Keys (FKs).
Including screenshots of ERD and relational in the report.

TASK2: DATABASE IMPLEMENTATION

Our task is to: 
1.	Identify for each table, the columns, data types, length, and constraints (all Pks, UKs, Not Null, CKs and FKs).



2.	Use Oracle APEX, to write the DDL commands to:

  •	Create the necessary tables;
  
  •	Add Primary key constraints;
  
  •	Add Foreign key constraints;
  
  •	Add appropriate CHECK constraints;
  
  •	Add appropriate UNIQUE constraints;
  
  •	Provide Screenshots of all the script you run.
  
  
  
  
3.	Use Oracle APEX, to populate the database tables with at least 5 records. And provide screenshot of inserted records. 

4.	Queries: 
We will write at least 8 queries (select, select with join, update, delete commands). For each query, define the question that the query should answer and the SQL statement required to answer it. The questions should be of business value and should provide information you think is important to the management and Include screenshots of the result of each query in our report as a proof that it worked and produced the desired result.

Queries should include these if possible:

  •	Conditions using various operators on numbers, text and date columns with results sorted
  
  •	Conditions applied to more than one column (AND/OR in the WHERE clause)
  
  •	Arithmetic calculations and concatenated columns
  
  •	Column aliases where required
  
  •	Aggregate functions  (SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX, COUNT etc.)
  
  •	Column Concatenation 
  
  
  
  
PROJECT DOCUMENTATION 
Creating a report that includes the following: 

 •	ERD Diagram: Illustrate all entites and relationships describing the case study. Each entity must include attributes.
 
 •	Entity and relationship description:  Describe the purpose of each entity and relationship of the case study.
 
 •	Relational Model: Describe the transformation rules used to generate the relational model from the ERD.  
 
 •  Query description: Describe all the queries  implemented, including a screenshot of the query code and its result.
 
 
 
 
ORAL DEFENSE
An oral defense will be conducted by group members at a given time slot and will involve a walkthrough and discussion of the database design and SQL script. Questions relating to the DDL and DML commands will be asked to each group. In addition, the student ability to collaborate and participate in the deliverable accomplishment will be assessed. Students should keep track and record  the collaboration between team members by using BBL Discussion Board.
